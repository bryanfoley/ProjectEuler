# ProjectEuler
This repository contains the solutions I have made to the algorithmic puzzles available from ProjectEuler.net.
The solutions are written in C++ or Python and try to find the desired result in the shortest time possible with the least computational complexity.
The challenge is to solve each puzzle using one processor and in no more than 1 minute of execution time, although I present solutions which can be performed in 2 seconds or less.
